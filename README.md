## 🔬 About Me

I'm an independent researcher passionate about understanding and unifying the fundamental operations in deep learning. My work focuses on creating principled frameworks that bridge theory and practice in neural architecture design.

Currently working on expanding the **Generalized Windowed Operation (GWO)** ecosystem—a theoretical framework that unifies matrix multiplication, convolution, and attention mechanisms through a shared grammar.

## 📝 Research Highlights

### Window is Everything (2025)
A unified theory of neural operations that decomposes any operation into three orthogonal components:
- **Path (P)**: Defines operational locality
- **Shape (S)**: Encodes geometric structure and symmetry
- **Weight (W)**: Determines feature importance

**Key Contributions:**
- 🎯 **Principle of Structural Alignment**: Optimal generalization through data-operation alignment
- 🧠 **Information Bottleneck Connection**: Formal grounding in information theory
- 📊 **Complexity Dichotomy**: Static capacity vs. adaptive regularization
- 🛠️ **Generative Framework**: Systematic pathway from data properties to architecture design

## 🚀 Current Focus

Building the **GWO Ecosystem**:
- 🔧 Practical implementations and tooling
- 📚 Educational resources and tutorials
- 🤝 Community-driven architecture discovery
- 🔬 Extended applications to new domains
